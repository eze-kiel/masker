# masker

A small web plateform designed to blur faces on pictures.
The main goal of this plateform is to allow protests' photographers to share pictures of the events without exposing people to facial recognition programs.

Once you have uploaded the picture you want to blur, a download link will be given to you. Once you have donwload your picture, it is completely removed from the disk. Nothing is kept.

## Classifiers

I use classifiers from David Bradley and Rainer Lienhart. I DO NOT OWN the XML files that are used.

## Disclaimer

This program is not 100% accurate, and pictures can need some manual modification.
